  "category": "Large Language Model",
  "description": "Llama is a family of foundational large language models developed by Meta AI. Known for their strong performance and openly available weights (under a custom license), Llama models are widely used for research, development, and self-hosted AI applications.",
  "features": [
    "Openly available model weights",
    "Multiple model sizes (e.g., 8B, 70B, 405B parameters)",
    "Pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions",
    "Competitive performance",
    "Large context windows (e.g., 128K tokens)",
    "Multilingual support",
    "Strong coding capabilities",
    "Can be fine-tuned",
    "Associated safety tools (e.g., Llama Guard)"
  ],
  "pricing": {
    "model": "Model weights are free (subject to license). Costs arise from compute infrastructure (local hardware/cloud).",

      }
    ],
    "notes": "Primary cost is compute infrastructure for hosting/running the model."
  },
  "pros": [
    "Openly available weights empower customization/research/local deployment",
    "State-of-the-art performance for open models",
    "Multiple model sizes offer flexibility",
    "No direct cost for the model itself",
    "Thriving community and ecosystem (e.g., llama.cpp)",
    "Allows building applications with data privacy (if self-hosted)"
