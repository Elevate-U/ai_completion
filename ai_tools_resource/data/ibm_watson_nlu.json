  "description": "IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding is a cloud-based service that uses deep learning to extract metadata from text such as entities, relationships, keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion, and syntax. It allows users to analyze unstructured text data to understand context and meaning. The service offers pre-trained models and the ability to create custom models for specific domains or requirements, integrating with the IBM Cloud ecosystem.",
  "features": [
    "Entities: Detect and extract named entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) from text.",
    "Categories (Beta): Categorize text using a hierarchical classification system.",
    "Classifications: Classify text into predefined categories.",
    "Concepts: Identify high-level concepts that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.",
    "Emotions: Detect emotions (joy, sadness, anger, etc.) expressed in the text.",
    "Sentiment (Beta): Determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the text.",
    "Relations: Identify relationships between entities in the text.",
    "Metadata: Extract metadata from web pages, such as author, title, and publication date.",
    "Semantic Roles: Parse sentences into subject-action-object form and identify entities and keywords that are subjects or objects of an action."
